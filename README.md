# encode
this is a library to encode 'Base64'

simply pull the repository and run

to change test with different input you can change the input variable or uncomment the code to get the input while running the poject. 

Note: the program assumes that the input is correct and is based on the test's requirements(multiples of 3), the library can improve by adding exception handling with some refactoring.
